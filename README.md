Every small entry from placing an order, to processing payments, to the delivery of an item can be lodged and preserved on the Blockchain network that can help track the complete journey of an order, can help identify defects/gaps in the process etc. and with Blockchain, issues like money laundering or payment thefts can be completely eliminated.

Blockchain also completely gets rid of intermediaries and illegal activities since there is no centralized authority governing the process.
